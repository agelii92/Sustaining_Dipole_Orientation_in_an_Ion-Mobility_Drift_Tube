These scripts was used in the data extraction and analysis process. Note that these scripts are desgined for a very specific structure of folders with specific names, and will therefore
not work on any arbritrary computer. Further, access to the simulation data is needed for any useful purpose of this code. The data cannot be accessed without the permission of the
supervisors of this project.

Thus, these files are provided as an example of how to handle data from GROMACS simulation, for further insight in this project.
